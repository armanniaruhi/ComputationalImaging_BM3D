# Computational Imaging
> ## Denoising Project
> ### Team Members:
> - Arman Niaruhi
> - Haitham El Euch
> ### Project Description:
> In this project, we are going to implement several denoising algorithms and check their performance on different types of images. 
> The algorithms that we are going to implement are:
> - Gaussian Filter 
> - Bilateral Filter
> - Non-Local Means Filter 
> - BM3D Filter
> - Bergman TV
> - Chambolle TV
> - Wavelet
> ### Project Plan:
> - 1 Step:
> Implement the methods and test them on public Dataset.
> - 2 Step:
> Test the methods on our own dataset.
> - 3 Step:
> Compare the results and prepare the presentation.
